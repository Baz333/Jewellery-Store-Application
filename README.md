Jewellery Store Application

This is a program for the purpose of keeping track of stock in a jewellery store. The program allows the user to add a display case to the application, display trays to a specific display case, and jewellery items to a specific display tray. Jewellery items can consist of different materials which can also be manually added. A save and load function is also in place for persistence. Stock valuation is also available for both the entire stock and each display case.
